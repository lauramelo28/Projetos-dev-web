        Heat Shield Inspections Underway on Artemis I Orion Spacecraft
    </h2>

    <p>
        Inside the Multi-Payload Processing Facility at NASAâ€™s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, engineers and technicians conduct inspections of the heat shield on the Orion spacecraft for the Artemis I mission. Orion returned to Kennedy on Dec. 30, 2022, after splashing down in the Pacific Ocean on Dec. 11, following a 1.4-million-mile mission beyond the Moon and back.
